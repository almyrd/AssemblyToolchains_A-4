SYNOPSIS This Toolchain is designed to enhance and optimize the
usability of GDB Enhanced Features (GEF) by automating certain processes
and tasks on the User’s behalf.  The goal of this project is to enable
lower-level .nasm files to Compile and Debug seamlessly, in an
accessible User Interface.

   The goal of this project is to create a tool that simplifies the
process of compilation and debugging by reducing the number of steps and
instructions required.

$ or manually
$ wget -O ~/.gdbinit-gef.py -q https://gef.blah.cat/py
$ echo source ~/.gdbinit-gef.py >> ~/.gdbinit

$ or alternatively from inside gdb directly
$ gdb -q
(gdb) pi import urllib.request as u, tempfile as t;
g=t.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=’-gef.py’); open(g.name,
’wb+’).write(u.urlopen(’https://tinyurl.com/gef-main’).read());

ENVIRONMENT

Assumptions for Intel x86 Environment in Kali Linux:

Install NASM - sudo apt-get install nasm
Install VSCode - sudo apt-get install code
Install assembly extension inside VS Code - extension name: nasm
Assign the above extension to .s files
Install GDB - sudo apt-get install gdb
Install GEF - https://github.com/hugsy/gef
Create / download x-86_toolchain.sh script
Make the above script executable
Add the above script to PATH: **echo ’export
PATH=$PATH:~/ITSC204/scripts’ >> .bashrc Note: writing it to .bashrc
makes the path persistent within bash
