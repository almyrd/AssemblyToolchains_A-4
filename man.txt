.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad l 
.nh
This toolchain was built for applying modality and ease of use to compiling and debugging NASM based assembly code.
It uses \fBnasm\fR to compile and \fBld\fR to link with options to debug and run inside \fBgdb\fR.
This version was modified to run in x86-64 bit architecture by default.

The goal of this project is to create a tool that simplifies the process of compilation and debugging by reducing the number of steps and instructions required. 

Instructions for installation can be located at: \fIhttps://github.com/LubosKuzma/ITSC204/blob/main/scripts/README.md
